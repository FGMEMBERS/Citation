Still to do:
------------

flightdeck:
* Modelling: overhead panel
* Modelling: more details like bags on side-panels, maps, manuals etc
             (a manual like on 707?)
* Modelling: pilots seats need some work
* XML/Nasal: make circuit breakers functional? (Only if it doesn't
             take thousands of lines of nasal! Treat them like
             switches? Add to every feature a
               <condition>
                 <property> (bool)
                   systems/electrical/cb/correspondingCircuitBreaker
                 </property>
               </condition> ?)

cabin:
* Rembrandt: all lights
* Texturing: contours of seats and refreshment-center need
             improvement (under certain light conditions very hazy)
* XML/Nasal: make seat levers functional?

exterior:
* Rembrandt: wing lights (used for checking for icing)
* Modelling: more small gadgets/antennas/tubes/vents etc
* Modelling: more details for landing gear
* Texturing: plating, rivets & stuff (-> livery)
* Texturing: animated engine intakes?
* XML/Nasal: speed-brake's animations are still not perfect :P

generic:
* Texturing: better wood texture!!!
* Modelling: MPModel!!! (LoRes)
