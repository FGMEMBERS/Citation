Citation II:
============

Still to do:
------------

flightdeck:
* adjust view height vs human model height vs cabin height - humans appear too big / Citation is too small (Thanks to Thomas Polzer)
* Modelling: overhead panel
* Modelling: more details like bags on side-panels, maps, manuals etc
             (a manual like on 707?)
* XML/Nasal: ongoing: circuit breakers go into: prop:controls/electric/circuit-breakers/bus-[emer|left|right]/cb-*

cabin:
* Modelling: aft compartment

exterior:
* Modelling: more details for landing gear
* Texturing: plating, rivets & stuff (-> normalmap) WIP
* Effects:   Thrust/Flame effect doesn't work properly, when engines cut off in flight
             the thrust flame doesn't disappear. It illudes me why.

generic:
* Texturing: better wood texture!?!
* Modelling: MPModel!!! (LoRes)
* XML/Nasal: Need version check for all shaders and effects for backward compability!
* XML/Nasal: Spool up behaves somewhat strange: when ignition switched off during spool
             up, it stays at current value until ignition is switched on again. Should
             spool down instead! While at it, starter-disengage should be hung into
             that as well!
* XML        Get rid of the startup sound! Really annoying!

             This is caused by <mode>in-transit</mode> sounds iirc, and can be easily
             mitigated in the sound config by adding a condition check on some /sim/signals/
             property, or on /sim/startup/splash-alpha=0

autopilot:
* XML/Nasal: When "Pitch-Trim" circuit-breaker is pulled
             (prop:controls/electric/circuit-breakers/bus-left/cb-pitch-trim),
             the autopilot can no longer control elevator-trim! Manual input on
             Trim-wheel is always possible, but not for A/P!
             Manual states: If electric elevator trim is malfunctioning/off the
             autopilot should no longer be used! Seems like there's no automatic
             A/P off. It simply should stop having an effect.

multiplayer:
* XML/Nasal: Lights non functional over mp -> needs fix !Not intended over mp, should be built into the mp-version ($FGDATA/AI/Aircraft/Citation/Citation-II.*)
