Still to do:
------------

flightdeck:
* Modelling: overhead panel
* Modelling: more details like bags on side-panels, maps, manuals etc
             (a manual like on 707?)
* Modelling: pilots seats need some work
* XML/Nasal: make circuit breakers functional? (Only if it doesn't
             take thousands of lines of nasal! Treat them like
             switches? Add to every feature a
               <condition>
                 <property type="bool">
                   systems/electrical/cb/correspondingCircuitBreaker
                 </property>
               </condition> ?)
* XML:       Bring Rembrandt light volumes and animations up to specs

cabin:
* Modelling: aft compartment
* Texturing: contours of interior walls, seats and refreshment-center
             need improvement (under certain light conditions very
             hazy)
* XML/Nasal: make seat levers functional?

exterior:
* Modelling: more details for landing gear
* Modelling: Cargo doors
* Texturing: plating, rivets & stuff (-> livery)
* Texturing: animated engine intakes?

generic:
* Texturing: better wood texture!?!
* Modelling: MPModel!!! (LoRes)
