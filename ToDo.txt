Still to do:
------------

flightdeck:
* Modelling: overhead panel
* Modelling: more details like bags on side-panels, maps, manuals etc
             (a manual like on 707?)
* Modelling: pilots seats need some work
* XML/Nasal: circuit breakers go into:
             (prop:controls/electric/circuit-breakers/bus-[emer|left|right]/cb-*)
* XML:       Bring Rembrandt light volumes and animations up to specs

cabin:
* Modelling: aft compartment
* Texturing: contours of interior walls, seats and refreshment-center
             need improvement (under certain light conditions very
             hazy)
* XML/Nasal: make seat levers functional?

exterior:
* Modelling: more details for landing gear
* Texturing: plating, rivets & stuff (-> livery)
* Texturing: animated engine intakes?

generic:
* Texturing: better wood texture!?!
* Modelling: MPModel!!! (LoRes)
* XML/Nasal: Need version check for all shaders and effects for backward compability!
* XML/Nasal: Spool up behaves somewhat strange: when ignition switched off during spool
             up, it stays at current value until ignition is switched on again. Should
             spool down instead! While at it, starter-disengage should be hung into
             that as well!

autopilot:
* XML/Nasal: When "Pitch-Trim" circuit-breaker is pulled
             (prop:controls/electric/circuit-breakers/bus-left/cb-pitch-trim),
             the autopilot can no longer control elevator-trim! Manual input on
             Trim-wheel is always possible, but not for A/P!
             Manual states: If electric elevator trim is malfunctioning/off the
             autopilot should no longer be used! Seems like there's no automatic
             A/P off. It simply should stop having an effect.

multiplayer:
* XML/Nasal: Rudder movements non functional over mp -> needs fix
             Lights non functional over mp -> needs fix
